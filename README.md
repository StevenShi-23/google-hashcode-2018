# Google Hashcode 2018

This year's question is about request-vehicle matching for cars. Basically, we are given a grid as map, a number of vehicles, and a list of requests, and we are required to find the best matching given an evaluation function. The detailed problem statement can be found [here](https://github.com/StevenShi-23/google-hashcode-2018/blob/master/online_qualification_round_2018.pdf). Below we present our iteration over solving the problem.

# Usage
```
python solution.py <input-filename>.in
```
The program will write the solution to __<input-filenamme>.out__.

# Solution 1 (Score: 1.562.473)

At first, we proposed a greedy method to select the vehicle with highest score given a time for a request.
