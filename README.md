## Introduction
This year's question is about request-vehicle matching for self-driving cars (actually the self-driving part is not as important). Basically, we are given a grid as map, a number of vehicles, and a list of requests, and we are required to find the best matching given an evaluation function. 
This is proven to be an NP-hard question, but fortunately, I (Ziji) am an intern at Fleet Management at nuTonomy, and this is not new to us.
We proposed a greedy method to select the vehicle with highest score given a time for a request.
